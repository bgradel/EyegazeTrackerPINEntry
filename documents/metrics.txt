Time to enter each digit (ms) measured from the acceptance of the previous digit to the acceptance of the current digit

Total time for PIN entry (ms) measured from beginning of PIN entry time to acceptance of the last digit.

Movement time for each PIN entry as a Fitts' Law Task necessary measurements for this include
- Saccade amplitude measured in pixels
- distance on PIN pad (can be calculated directly from UI elements)

Mesurement of fixation including:
- Centroid of fixation
- Time of fixation
- Fixation duration
As well as information on how fixation is detected (dispertion vs. velocity based filter)

Complimentary metrics
- Sampling rate of the device
- Measure of calibration accuracy
- Visual representation of gaze movement
