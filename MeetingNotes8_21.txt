Write end text shorter like bullet points

turn on sticky mouse or mouse emulation before beginning the experiment. Maybe keep reminding them.

Fix weird pictures for the questions at the end.

Need to figure out how to actually visualize and analyze the data.

Submit button should be bigger, more obvious that it NEEDS TO BE PRESSED
